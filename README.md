# Videochat Extension FreeCM

This Chromium extension improves your experience on CooMeet's free video chat service by helping you identify which users are real people and which are likely bots.

Originally part of the larger Videochat Extension project, this functionality was moved into its own dedicated extension with several enhancements. This separation occurred when the main Videochat Extension project changed direction to focus on general WebRTC monitoring rather than site-specific improvements.

This extension is distributed under the MIT open source license, even though the main Videochat Extension project has since become closed-source with a completely new codebase.

## Features

- ü§ñ Bot Detection: Automatically identifies potential bot accounts
- üö´ Auto-Hide: Option to automatically hide video feed from suspected bots 
- üîá Auto-Mute: Option to automatically mute audio when bots are detected
- üåé Country Detection: Shows the country of your chat partner
- ‚ú® Minor Improvements: Various small enhancements
- üëÅÔ∏è Alternative Mode: Backup UI that is more resilient to website changes
